  In this challenge, I was asked to gather seasonal data to demonstrate how variable the weather can be in the summer and winter. I will then provide recommendations for further analysis to help the surf shop sustain their business throughout the year. 

By comparing the June and December data summaries, I can conclude that June has more accurate data due to the larger count size. The December data shows that Oahu experienced more precipitation on average, in December than in June. This assumes that the surf shop's business would have better foot traffic in June.

To gain more insight on each years' data, I would use the pivot table and chart in Excel. A pivot chart can be filtered by year and precipitation amounts for each station for each day. The pivot chart and table can illustrate the data to make more detailed business actions. I think it would be helpful to make histogram graphs of the average preciptation in months of June and December across the years to make some sort of prediction of future precipitation levels. By identifying some sort of pattern of percipitation data, the surf shop can be prepared for the future.
